  "InputText": "The Solar System consists of the Sun and all the celestial objects bound to it by gravity, including the eight major planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and more. The Sun is a star located at the center of the Solar System. It provides light, heat, and energy, making life possible on Earth.\n\nThe eight major planets in our Solar System are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has unique characteristics, and some have moons of their own. For example, Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon.\n\nAsteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, mainly found in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Comets are icy bodies that develop tails when they approach the Sun.\n\nStudying the Solar System provides insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, as well as the potential for extraterrestrial life. Scientists use various tools and telescopes to explore and learn more about the mysteries of our Solar System.\n",
